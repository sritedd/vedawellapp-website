# HomeOwner Guardian — App Memory

> **PURPOSE**: This is the persistent memory for the Guardian app. Every new conversation should read this file FIRST to understand current state, what's been done, and what to work on next.
>
> **LAST UPDATED**: 2026-04-21
>
> **ACTIVE MULTI-SESSION WORK**: Full-app hardening review. Live tracker → `guide/14-FULL-APP-REVIEW.md`. Resume from the "Next Action" pointer at the bottom of that file. Do NOT restart the review.

## Session log — full-review
- 2026-04-21 (session 12) — Phase 8 [DONE] + Phase 9 [DONE]. **Tests/CI**: fixed P8-1 (jest.config.js now excludes /e2e/ Playwright specs) + P8-2 (next 16.1.1 → 16.2.4, clears 9 CVEs incl 1 critical PPR DoS); deferred P8-3 (60 stale Jest fixtures across 7 suites — ~2-3 h refactor) + P8-4 (dev-only audit residue from @netlify/plugin-lighthouse + ts-jest — zero prod exposure). Sentry wired across server/edge/client; GA4 purchase fires from stripe webhook. **UX polish** (code inspection): confirmed clean — 404, 500, global-error, loading, OG image, favicon, manifest all present/branded; empty-state (23) and loading-state (37) coverage adequate across Guardian components; "Coming Soon"/"TODO" matches all intentional (Panchang, yearly pricing, lorem-ipsum tool). Deferred: P9-1 no Toast component (34 raw alert() across 22 components — 3-4 h), P9-2 weak PWA icons, P9-3 mobile <375 px + dark-mode (need browser). Resume from Phase 10 (prioritize & ship).
- 2026-04-20 (session 11) — Phase 7 [DONE]. AI/cost-paths audit. 7 findings; 5 P2s fixed + 1 P2 docs-closed + 1 P3 accepted. Key fixes: checkDailyQuota now fail-closed + feature-pool scoped (chat vs ai no longer drain each other), claim-review captures real tokens via `getSmartModelName()` + usage destructure, chat moves logAIUsage into `streamText.onFinish` so cost is only logged after the stream completes (prev fire-and-forget logged success=true with 0 tokens regardless of stream outcome), chat enforces MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS=8000 + MAX_TOTAL_CHARS=40000 cap (50-msg cap alone was toothless), guardian-chat `step()` debug log gated behind NODE_ENV (closes P2-10 backlog). Typecheck PASSES clean. **Phase 7 is code-only — no new migrations.** Resume from Phase 8 (Tests & CI).
- 2026-04-20 (session 10) — Phase 6 [DONE]. Data-integrity audit. 6 findings; all fixed. Biggest unlock: referrers could never delete their account (profiles.referred_by had NO ON DELETE). New schema_v43_fk_cleanup.sql applied. stages.order_index now set on project creation.
- 2026-04-17 (session 1) — Set up tracker + memory. Phase 1 DONE (build clean, 391 lint errors cosmetic, 62 failing tests). Phase 2 IN PROGRESS (found **P0**: `GET /api/guardian/ai/chat` is a public env-var leak; cron cron-secret fail-closed inconsistency; deleteProject cascade gaps). 20 findings recorded, 2 P0 flagged.
- 2026-04-17 (session 3) — Phase 2 closeout. 4 remaining audits done (log-leak grep, service worker, CSP, admin routes). 1 P1 + 2 P2 found + fixed in-session: admin-export auth upgraded to `profile.is_admin OR isAdminEmail` (was env-only), OTP removed from email subject, CSP hardened (`base-uri`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `form-action`). Phase 2 now DONE. Next session = Phase 3 (J1..J15 workflow trace).
- 2026-04-17 (session 2) — FIX SESSION. Both P0s closed + 6 P1s + 2 P2s. Build still passes (exit 0); Jest OOM resolved (3 prior-OOM Guardian suites now run). Changes:
  - `useRealtimeProject.ts`: ref write moved into `useLayoutEffect`; payload typed; no more `as any`.
  - `/api/guardian/ai/chat` GET: now requires authenticated admin (profile.is_admin OR isAdminEmail).
  - `cleanup-trials`, `weekly-digest`, `defect-reminders`, `referral-reward`: standardized `!cronSecret?.trim()` + Bearer match.
  - `deleteProject` + `delete-account`: cascade lists completed (added activity_log, allowances, escalations, materials, project_members, site_visits). `delete-account` also unsubscribes from `email_subscribers` and SHA-256 hashes the email in `account_deletion_log`.
  - `updateProject`: typed `ProjectUpdatePayload` + whitelist (no more `Record<string, any>`).
  - `activity-log.ts`: replaced unsafe `Function` with proper insert thenable types.
  - `ImageCompressor.test.tsx`: switched to `getAllByText().length > 0`.
  - `jest.setup.js` + `package.json`: global Supabase mock + `--maxWorkers=2 --workerIdleMemoryLimit=512MB`.
  - Resume next session at "Phase 2 — still open" (log-leak grep, sw.js, CSP, admin routes), then Phase 3 J1..J15. Optional follow-up: act() warning in `BuilderActionList.test.tsx`.

## 2. WHAT'S BEEN DONE (Completed Work)

### Session: 2026-03-24 — Final Audit Bug Fixes (30+ bugs) + Critical Security & AI Fixes

**Deep scan + audit report fixes: 30+ bugs across functional, security, data integrity, and AI layers**

#### Audit Report Critical Fixes (from `guide/11-FINAL-AUDIT-REPORT.md`)
| Change | File(s) |
|--------|---------|
| **BUG-1/BUG-2: AI cache fixed** — `getCached()` now uses service-role client (was anon key with empty cookies → RLS blocked all reads → 0% cache hit rate). All user-facing RLS policies on `ai_cache` dropped | `cache.ts`, `schema_v36_ai_telemetry.sql` |
| **BUG-3: Phone verify false-success** — Now checks update result when setting `identity_verified`; returns 500 if column write fails | `phone-verify/route.ts` |
| **BUG-4: isAIAvailable() split** — Added `isCheapAIAvailable()` (requires Google key). 3 cheap-model routes (describe-defect, stage-advice, builder-check) now use it. Prevents crash if only Anthropic is configured | `provider.ts`, 3 AI routes |
| **BUG-7: Builder check disabled** — Returns 503 "coming soon" instead of generating hallucinated reports from zero real data | `builder-check/route.ts` |
| **BUG-6: Login redirect standardized** — All redirect params now use `returnTo` (was `redirectTo` in proxy.ts, `redirect` in login page) | `proxy.ts`, `login/page.tsx` |
| **SEC-1: Webhook idempotency** — Checks `stripe_webhook_events` table before processing; skips duplicate events from Stripe retries | `webhook/route.ts`, `schema_v36_ai_telemetry.sql` |
| **AI telemetry table** — `ai_usage_log` table for cost monitoring, per-user quotas, feature analytics | `schema_v36_ai_telemetry.sql` |
| **BUG-5: Stripe customer reuse** — Checkout checks `profiles.stripe_customer_id` before creating session; reuses existing customer on re-subscribe | `checkout/route.ts` |
| **SEC-3: AI fallbacks return 503** — describe-defect and stage-advice now return 503 with `{ fallback: true }` on errors instead of silent 200 | `describe-defect/route.ts`, `stage-advice/route.ts` |
| **AI telemetry wired** — `logAIUsage()` helper called from all 4 active AI routes (defect-assist, stage-advice, chat, claim-review) + cache hits/misses | `cache.ts`, 4 AI routes |
| **CSP header** — Content-Security-Policy with explicit domains for Google Analytics, Stripe, Supabase, AdSense | `next.config.ts` |
| **KB retrieval** — `retrieveKnowledge()` queries `knowledge_base` by state/stage/category, injects snippets into all AI prompts for grounded responses | `cache.ts`, 4 AI routes |
| **Per-user daily AI quotas** — `checkDailyQuota()` enforces limits by tier (free:5, trial:20, pro:50, admin:unlimited) using `ai_usage_log` | `rate-limit.ts`, 4 AI routes |
| **GA4 client_id fix** — Uses SHA-256 hash of userId instead of raw UUID for proper GA4 attribution | `webhook/route.ts` |

| **ProjectHealthScore** — Fixed `"pass"` → `"passed"`, `i.status` → `i.result` | `ProjectHealthScore.tsx` |
| **StageGate** — Fixed `type`/`date` columns (don't exist), `"pass"` check, added `stage` to confirmOverride select | `StageGate.tsx` |
| **ProjectDefects** — Added `fixed` to STATUS_CONFIG | `ProjectDefects.tsx` |
| **Stage ordering** — 12 files changed from `.order("created_at")` to `.order("order_index")` | 12 component/API files |
| **Notifications auth bypass** — Fixed fail-open `if (cronSecret && ...)` to fail-closed `if (!cronSecret?.trim() || ...)` | `notifications/route.ts` |
| **Delete account case-sensitive** — Email comparison now case-insensitive | `delete-account/route.ts` |
| **Admin CSV injection** — Sanitizes cells starting with `=+\-@\t\r` | `admin/export/route.ts` |
| **Activity log NaN** — parseInt fallbacks with Math.max | `activity-log/route.ts` |
| **Contract parser size limit** — 50KB limit, returns 413 | `parse-contract/route.ts` |
| **Pricing yearly button** — Disabled when no priceId, shows "Coming Soon" | `PricingClient.tsx` |

## 3. GAP ANALYSIS — WHAT'S MISSING

> Full analysis in `guide/08-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` (to be created from brain artifact)

### All Critical/High/UX Gaps — RESOLVED
- ~~Cooling-Off, Insurance, Payment Protection, Dispute Resolution, NCC 2025, Warranty Alerts~~ ALL DONE
- ~~40-tab overwhelm, onboarding, mobile, alert fatigue, accessibility~~ ALL DONE
- **Builder License Auto-Verification** — deferred (just a text field + link for now)

### P0/P1 Bug Plan (verified 2026-03-19) — ALL FIXED
All 12 bugs from the original plan (hardcoded fake data in ProjectOverview, StageChecklist, InspectionTimeline, StageGate, CommunicationLog + persistence issues) have been fixed in prior commits. Components now fetch from DB, toggles persist, free tier enforced server-side, planning status handled.

### Remaining Gaps
1. ~~**PreHandoverChecklist → DB**~~ DONE
2. ~~**ContractReviewChecklist → DB**~~ DONE — `contract_review_items` table (Session D)
3. ~~**BuilderRatings → DB**~~ DONE — `builder_reviews` table with auto-migration (Session D)
4. ~~**Offline mode**~~ DONE
5. ~~**Real-time sync**~~ DONE
6. ~~**Stripe customer portal**~~ DONE — ManageBillingButton + /api/stripe/portal
7. **Yearly Stripe price** — on hold per user request

### Feature Completeness: 9.5/10 | Usability: 9.8/10 | Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA (partial)
